overview: >
  Dream Yacht Sales (DYS) is also another arm of Dream Yacht Group. They provide professional consultancy, tailored solutions and expert advice, making yacht ownership simple and easy. DYS' original site was hastily put together as the company had spend significant time and effort into a yacht configuration tool for prospective buyers. In doing so, a lot of corners where cut, an off-the-shelf Wordpress template which was not fit for purpose was used. The site was lacking in visual consistancy to its sister site, Dream Yacht Charter, and was in need of a re-work. I was tasked with overhauling the entire site and to visually align it to its charting sibling.

### The Problem
The company wants to attract more non-sailors to experience the joy of sailing. However it’s traditionally intimidating for someone (without some prior knowledge of sailing) to charter a boat, let alone knowing where to sail. Coupled with an ever growing list of destinations and charter types, making a decision where and what to book can be difficult.

**So how might we make it simpler for novices to charter a yacht while not alienating seasoned sailors?**

### The Goal
Leading and informing novice users (adventurers) through their onsite journey while giving traditional users (sailors) the power to quickly search for what they are looking for.

**In addition we were looking to:**
- Increasing online bookings *(particularly across Crewed and By-the-cabin Charters)*
- Reducing bounce rate for destination pages
- Reducing the amount of questions DYC get from prospective customers

### Scope of Work
- Qualitative and Quantitative User Research
- Information Architecture
- User Flow Mapping
- Wireframing
- Prototyping
- Mockups
- Design pattern library
- Email templates design

### Target Audience
Adventurous time poor professionals willing to pay a premium for a memorable experience. 

**Common pain points:**
- Overwhelming options
- Unuseful language
- Insufficient information available

### Process

- Quantitative and qualitative user research
- Competitor research
- Site usability, accessibility and heuristics
- Ideation & sketching
- Wireframes
- Mockups
- Prototypes
- UI design

#### Quantitative & qualitative user research
Digging into DYCs Google Analytics we were able to identify exactly where users were spending most of their time (what mattered to them), where they dropped off, the typical device they use.
 
Furthermore we used Hotjar to record active users sessions to observe how they browsed the site. The insights we gained were quite valuable. We identified users where going in circles, particularly when it came to browsing for Crewed Charters. 

#### Competitor Research
Not having extensive domain knowledge of sailing and chartering,  I set out to do some practical research on DYCs competitors to see how they presented themselves, what kind of language they use, as well as auditing some basic usability heuristics. I found that for the most part, with exception to very high-end premium yacht chartering sites, most if not all competitors were jamming their homepages with all sorts of information and there was not clear ‘What do I need to do here’. A common pattern that emerged was that of a hero section with no clear headline and a search utility that was usually below the fold.

In addition to these findings most sites were lacking in basic proper usage of typography. Which, in a domain with information rich content can be a pain point for users, as they are unable to quickly scan a page and become overwhelmed.

#### Site usability, accessibility and heuristics
DYCs site was lacking in basic usability.

#### Ideation & sketching
Get some sketches together of homepage, destinations, search, charter types

#### Wireframes
Starting off with a mobile-first approach.

### Results
**TBD**, development was suspended on this due to COVID-19!

### Lessons Learned
Sailing and chartering is very nuanced. Gaining knowledge in this domain takes considerable time and effort. It is very difficult to distill complex booking requirements. Business CRM always trumps, it’s difficult to shift business mind. Working remotely with a global team has it’s challenges.
